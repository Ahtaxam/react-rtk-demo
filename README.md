# Project Name: Redux Toolkit Practice

## Description
This project serves as a practice ground for honing your skills in using Redux Toolkit, a powerful library that simplifies Redux boilerplate and makes state management in React applications more efficient. The project focuses on implementing various Redux Toolkit features, such as creating slices, managing state, and handling asynchronous actions, to gain a better understanding of how to utilize Redux in a modern React application.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:
   ```
   cd redux-toolkit-practice
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the Application
To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure
The project follows a standard folder structure, organized as follows:

- `src`: Contains all the source code for the application.
  - `features`: Houses different Redux Toolkit slices, each representing a specific feature/module of the application.
  - `store`: Defines the Redux store, including the root reducer and middleware configuration.
  - `App.js`: The entry point of the application where components are composed.
  - `index.js`: The entry point of the application where the ReactDOM rendering occurs.

## Redux Toolkit Usage
Throughout the project, you will explore various Redux Toolkit concepts, including:
- Creating Redux slices using the `createSlice` function.
- Defining initial state, reducers, and actions within each slice.
- Handling asynchronous operations using `createAsyncThunk`.
- Combining multiple slices into a root reducer using `combineReducers`.
- Configuring the Redux store with custom middleware and enhancers.
